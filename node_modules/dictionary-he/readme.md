# dictionary-he

Hebrew spelling dictionary.

## What is this?

This is a Hebrew dictionary,
generated by [`wooorm/dictionaries`][dictionaries] from
[`hspell.ivrix.org.il`][source],
normalized and packaged so that it can be installed and used like other
dictionaries.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package when integrating with tools that perform spell checking
(such as [`nodehun`][nodehun], [`nspell`][nspell]) or when making such tools.

## Install

In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install dictionary-he
```

## Use

```js
import dictionaryHe from 'dictionary-he'

dictionaryHe(function (error, he) {
  if (error) throw error
  console.log(he)
  // To do: use `he` somehow
})
```

Yields:

```js
{dic: <Buffer>, aff: <Buffer>}
```

Where `dic` and `aff` are [`Buffer`][buffer]s for `index.dic` and `index.aff`
respectively.
